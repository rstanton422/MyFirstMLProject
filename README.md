# MyFirstMLProject
my first Machine Learning project. No large datasets, just a way to familiarize myself with many of the ML algos that are out there

For this project, the idea is to analyze a dataset of coupon users and determine whether or not someone will use a coupon on a sample set.
I used 6 different ML methods to compare accuracy.
- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Supoort Vector Machine
- Decision Tree Learning
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbor
